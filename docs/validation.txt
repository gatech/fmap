Justification from author: http://galleryproject.org/node/101768#comment-375208
"When I started to work in this theme, my intention was to basically allow to browse
my gallery on mobile devices. I did not intent to implement all features, as I don't
want to maintain, upload, etc my gallery form a mobile device. I still have a "proper"
pc where I can do those tasks."
